# ModuleTemplate-Clone-Me
A Basic Module Template you can clone to make your own functional Module for the Randomizer mod! (Includes template package. Doesn't include the Core Module dll, please download)

## Reading the Source code of the Framework
Don't want to use Ilspy or the like to read the source code of the Core Module?

Then you can always check it out on github: https://github.com/Lyralei1/TheRandomizer-Core/tree/master

However, this does not include the DLL you'll need to download! Please consult the tutorial file of this repository: https://github.com/Lyralei1/ModuleTemplate-Clone-Me/blob/master/ModuleTemplate/RenameMeModuleName.cs
